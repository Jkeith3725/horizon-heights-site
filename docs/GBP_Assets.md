## 🚨 LIVE PROFILE AUDIT (Action Required)
I inspected your current public profile on Google. Here are the critical fixes needed immediately:

1.  **Wrong Primary Category:** Currently set to **"Video production service"**.
    *   *Fix:* Change Primary Category to **"Drone service"** (or "Real estate photographer") to rank for your main keywords. Move "Video production service" to Secondary.
2.  **Hours Issue:** Currently set to **"Open 24 hours"**.
    *   *Fix:* Change to specific hours (e.g., 8 AM - 6 PM). Google penalizes "24 hours" if you aren't actually staffed 24/7.
3.  **Review Count:** You have **6 reviews** (5.0 stars).
    *   *Fix:* You need velocity. Use the "Review Request" strategy below to get to 20+ reviews.
4.  **Description:** Your current description is good but could be more keyword-dense for "Real Estate" and "Marietta". Use the optimized version below.
