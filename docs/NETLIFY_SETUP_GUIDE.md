# 🌐 How to Put Your Website Online (Netlify Setup)

Great job! Your code is now safe on GitHub. Now we need to turn it into a live website using **Netlify**.

## Step 1: Sign Up for Netlify
1.  Click this link: [https://app.netlify.com/signup](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
2.  Click the button that says **"Sign up with GitHub"**.
3.  If asked, click **"Authorize Netlify"**.

## Step 2: Create Your Site
1.  Once logged in, you'll see a dashboard. Click **"Add new site"** (usually a teal button).
2.  Select **"Import an existing project"**.
3.  Click **"GitHub"**.
4.  You might see a pop-up asking for permission. Click **"Authorize Netlify"** again if needed.
5.  You will see a list of your repositories. Click on **`horizon-heights-site`**.

## Step 3: Deploy!
1.  You will see a "Site settings" page.
2.  **Don't change anything!** The defaults are perfect.
    - Build command: (Leave empty)
    - Publish directory: `.` (or leave empty)
3.  Click the **"Deploy site"** button at the bottom.

## Step 4: See Your Site
1.  Netlify will work for a few seconds (you might see "Site deploy in progress").
2.  Once it says **"Site is live"**, click the green link (it will look like `random-name-12345.netlify.app`).
3.  **Check if your site loads!**

## Step 5: Connect Your Domain (The Final Step)
1.  On your Netlify dashboard, click **"Domain settings"** (or "Set up a custom domain").
2.  Type your domain: `horizonheightsproductions.com`
3.  Click **"Verify"**.
4.  Click **"Add domain"**.
5.  Netlify will show you some "DNS records" (A record and CNAME).
    - **STOP HERE** and reply to me. I will help you with the DNS part because it can be tricky!

**Once you have deployed the site (Step 3), please reply "Done" and paste the `netlify.app` link here so I can see it!**
