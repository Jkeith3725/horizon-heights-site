2. **Include location** - Marietta, Parkersburg, Athens, etc.
3. **Include service** - drone photography, real estate photos, event coverage
4. **Keep it natural** - Write for humans, not just search engines
5. **50-125 characters** - Long enough to be descriptive, short enough to be useful
6. **No keyword stuffing** - Don't repeat the same phrase multiple times
