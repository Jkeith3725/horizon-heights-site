> **Note:** The "Horizon Heights business" folder could not be entered; only a search‑result view is available. If you can provide a direct share link or grant access, I can pull its contents.

## Branding Assets & Recommendations
- **Logo / Visuals:** The profile picture on Facebook (shown in the screenshot) can serve as the primary logo.
- **Color Palette:** The page uses a dark‑blue background with bright accent colors (orange, teal) in the post graphics. Consider using these hues consistently across marketing material.
- **Typography:** The Facebook page uses a clean sans‑serif font (similar to "Inter" or "Roboto"). Adopt the same for web and print assets for visual cohesion.
- **Micro‑animations:** For a premium feel, add subtle hover effects on social media thumbnails and website buttons, mirroring the modern aesthetic of the Facebook page.

## Next Steps
1. **Provide access** to the "Horizon Heights business" folder (or a direct link) so I can extract any brand guidelines, logos, or other assets stored there.
2. **Confirm** the Meta Business Suite screenshot shows the expected dashboard; let me know if you need a deeper dive into any specific tab (Ads, Insights, Page Settings, etc.).
3. **If desired**, I can create a simple brand‑style guide markdown that pulls colors, fonts, and logo usage from the assets we have.
